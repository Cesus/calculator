# Calculator 5000

Wait no it's just a simple calculator...

## How to use

Click an integer button, then an operation button followed by another integer button. Finally click the equal button and your answer *tadah* you have your answer. If you want decimals, click the . button. Also I might add a method to prevent users from inputting strings with a try and except.

### Prerequisites

This is a highly technical program that requires a Intel 28-Core Xeon W-3175X and 3 terrabyte of RAM. Maybe even 4.

```
just kidding, you could run this on a toaster...actually you probably couldn't...
```

### Installing

Click clone, download, open with an ide or something.

```
Clone me! Open me with PyCharm! Run me! Delete me bc this is a sh!ttty calculator!
```

## Running the tests

Im not actually sure what a someone would put for this as I could copied the format. Im leaving this here though

### Break down into end to end tests

Blah blah blah

```
Did you know that the moon is slowly moving away from Earth? 85 million years ago it was 35 feet from the surface, thats half of a bowling lane!
```

### And coding style tests

BORING

```
Would you rather be a spider or the most boring man on earth?
Either way, you're still a web developer.
```

## Deployment

Why would someone deploy this?

## Built With

* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) - The programming language used
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/2/library/tkinter.html) - GUI framework

## Contributing

It would be a waste to contribute to this. I might redo this at the end of high school to see how much I learned though...

## Versioning

Still have 0 clue about versioning my stuff. HOWEVER I'm going to call this version alpha to be cool. ![Sunglasses emoji](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/products/Sunglasses_Emoji_be26cc0a-eef9-49e5-8da2-169bb417cc0b_large.png?v=1480481057)
