# Just a simple calculator

So I followed this tutorial on youtube (https://youtu.be/oq3lJdhnPp8) and I decided to add my personal taste to it.

Hopefully in the future I am able to make more and more projects like these (with of course better quality).

It would also be amazing if I had some coffee...

And improve my mark up skills

# Goodbye
